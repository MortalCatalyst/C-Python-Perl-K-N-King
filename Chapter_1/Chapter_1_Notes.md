## Notes

### Constants
In **C** all constants are defined. As in the TAX_RATE example (project_1_4).

```C
#define TAX_RATE 0.18f;
```

In **Perl** there was no way to successfully create a constant. Instead I defined a variable in capitals to signify i was constant using *my* to keep the scope local.

```Perl
my $TAX_RATE = 0.18;
```

In **Python** as in Perl there is no constants we can merely indicate by capitalizing the variable that our intention is to have a constant.
